            <p class="about-me-desc desc">I have a lot of hobbies, ranging from piano to programming. I enjoy learning as much as I can, and finding things to bring my life fulfillment and occupy my time with. I want to inspire, educate, and motivate as many people as I can, and also become extraordinarily wealthy in my lifetime.</p>
            <h1 class="top-section-header hobby">Piano</h1>
            <embed src="./images/piano.mp4" height="600" width="800" autostart="false">
            <p class="about-me-desc desc">When I was younger, I used to dabble with piano. Starting in 2020, I decided to take it more seriously, and I advanced my piano knowledge. I used to dabble with just my right hand, thinking it was impossible, but as I advanced my knowledge, I was surprised to find that it was actually possible to play with both hands.<br><br>Here's a video of me playing a few pieces on a Grand Piano in Burger Middle School!<br><br></p>

            <h1 class="top-section-header hobby">Programming</h1>
            <p class="about-me-desc desc">I have been into programming since I was in 5th grade, dabbling in various areas, like web, software, and game development.</p>
            <h1 class="top-section-header hobby">Reading</h1>
            <p class="about-me-desc desc">I think that certain books can provide a lifetime of information in some hundred pages, so I enjoy reading lots of books. Here's a picture of my favorite book: Ikigai!</p>

            <h1 class="top-section-header hobby">Web Design</h1>
            <p class="about-me-desc desc">Ever since I started my company <a href="https://quizzynow.com/about-us" class="quizzy">Quizzy</a>, I was met with the need to learn web design, in order to make visually compelling pages. By learning it, I have vastly expanded my knowledge of design theory. </p>
            <h1 class="top-section-header hobby">Losing Money (Trading)</h1>
            <p class="about-me-desc desc">I saw my friend make $1K-$4K/day trading stocks and forex, so I thought I could do the same, but much to my chagrin, I ended up losing many hundreds of dollars.</p>
